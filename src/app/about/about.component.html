    <div class="about">
        This website is a unique project that will serve as a platform where foremost underprivileged businessowners can promote
        their services and goods for our community. The Creator's Catalogue also displays a gallore of minority art/media. It is 
        no longer a secret that since the beginning of this country there has been animosity towards people who aren't White Americans 
        and our advancement. MOCC will be a non-discrimatory environment where ANY minority group or person of interest can safely 
        advertise display their brand/art. The main goal of this website is to promote minority creativity and help centralize the investments of 
        minority communities. We must keep the returns of the investments inside of the community so the youth will benefit from an ample size of 
        resources provided to them. This is just the beginning, THE MARATHON CONTINUES!
