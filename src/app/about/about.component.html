  <h2 class="title">About The MOCC</h2>

    <div class="intro">
        My name is Brandon L. Davis and I am the creator of this website/catalogue. I am an alumni of
        Hampden-Sydney College. The motivation behind this platform came from the education I recieved 
        from two very diverse environments as well as the potential it holds to impact the lives of many.
        At an early age, I educated myself about the history of my ancestory and what came with being an
        African American in America. As I expanded my knowledge, I realized that my community along with 
        various others that resembled mine did not have all of the necessary ingredients to reach their 
        full potential. In addition tothis, their businesses were not doing as well as others. During the 
        early 1900s, the potential of Tulsa, the Hayti community in Durham, Jackson Ward in Richmond, along with
        others was cut short due to hate and violence. The minority market hasn't had a similar standing since
        those communities existed. My goal is to restore what these places were determined to accomplish as well
        as increasing the overall value of the minority owned market. This inclusive environment will be designed to be a 
        digitalized and national collection of National Minority Owned Businesses.

    <div class="about">
        This website is a unique project that will serve as a platform where foremost underprivileged businessowners can promote
        their services and goods for our community. The Creator's Catalogue also displays a galore of minority art/media. It is 
        no longer a secret that since the beginning of this country there has been animosity towards people who aren't White Americans 
        and our advancement. MOCC will be a non-discrimatory environment where ANY minority group or person of interest can safely 
        advertise display their brand/art. The main goal of this website is to promote minority creativity and help centralize the investments of 
        minority communities. We must keep the returns of the investments inside of the community so the youth will benefit from an ample size of 
        resources provided to them. This is just the beginning, THE MARATHON CONTINUES!
