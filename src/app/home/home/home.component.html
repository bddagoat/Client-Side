            My name is Brandon L. Davis and I am the creator of this website/catalogue. I am currently
            a senior at Hampden-Sydney College. The motivation behind this platform came from the
            education I recieved from two very diverse environments. At an early age, I educated myself
            about my ancestory and what came with being an African American in America. As I expanded
            my knowledge, I realized that my community along with various others that resembled mine did
            not have all of the necessary ingredients to reach their full potential. In addition to
            this, their businesses were not doing as well as others. During the early 1900s, the
            potential of Tulsa, the Hayti community in Durham, Jackson Ward in Richmond, along with
            others were cut short by hate and violence. My goal is to restore what these places were
            determined to accomplish as well as increasing the overall value of the minority owned
            market. This environment will be designed to be a digitalized and national collection of
            Minority Owned Businesses.
